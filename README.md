# Google Calendar Automation System

This project is a Python-based automation system for Google Calendar, leveraging the Google Calendar API to perform various operations programmatically.

## Features

- [x] OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google
- [x] Create new events in the primary calendar
- [ ] List upcoming events
- [ ] Update existing events
- [ ] Delete events
- [ ] Set reminders for events
- [ ] Handle recurring events
- [ ] Integrate with other Google services (e.g., Gmail for event notifications)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-calendar-automation.git`

2. Install the required dependencies:
`pip install google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client`

3. Set up your Google Cloud Project and enable the Google Calendar API
  
4. Download your `credentials.json` file and place it in the project root directory

## Usage

Run the `main.py`file.

## My Learnings

Throughout this project, I've gained valuable insights into:

1. Working with Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication system
2. Handling API credentials securely
3. Interacting with RESTful APIs using Python
4. Managing date and time operations in Python
5. Error handling in API interactions
6. Structuring a Python project for API integration

## Future Improvements

- Implement a command-line interface for easier interaction
- Add support for multiple calendars
- Create a web interface using a framework like Flask or Django
- Implement batch operations for improved efficiency
- Add unit tests for robust code quality
